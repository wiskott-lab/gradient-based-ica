# gradient-based-ica

todo: when manuscript is ready, advertise the code and project

todo: try learning features for [action recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08561)

todo: learn features on imagenet, visualize first layer features and look at closest feature-space neighbors of images - cf. [NAT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.05310.pdf) and [check this out](http://cs231n.github.io/understanding-cnn/)

(todo: try another experiments to validate the method, for example the separation of elephants from savannas) too high dimensional output

todo: update old experiments such that they reset the estimator part after each encoder update, instead of tacking a regularizer onto the whole thing. this can be done by only saving the list of estimator variables after each update.

note: it didn't work out to get x and y coordinates as features from the "mnist experiment" of a character that moves around the canvas. 
todo: 

note: (todo: fix "shuffled_x" in bss experiments) or ignore
